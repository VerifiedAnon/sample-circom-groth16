### Sample groth16 circuit

#### Usage

Proof can be found in `build/nullifier/my_input/proof.json` and the verifying key in `build/nullifier/groth16_vkey.json`.
Public inputs can be found in `build/nullifier/my_input/public.json`.

#### Proof generation

To recompile the circuit and generate the proof and verifying key, run:

``` bash
npm run prove
```
